## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap custom overrides
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- It was a bit tricky figuring out how to apply the Bootstrap carousel. I had trouble figuring out how to apply flex to change the layout for mobile to desktop.
  I just needed to use `col-xxl-12` and that worked without `d-flex`. Still learning the ins and outs of Bootstrap.
- I thought the different backgrounds would be hard , but those were easy to figure out.
- The hardest for this whole project was probably when I tried to change the carousel arrow colors. The default color was too light for accessbility reasons.
  Also trying to change the placement of the carousel control was tricky at first.
  
### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
